# Procedo  
**An AI-powered Procedural Intelligence Tool for Arbitrators & Institutions**

## Problem Statement

Arbitration proceedings are shaped by continuously evolving legislature, institutional rules, and guidance that establish procedural frameworks, ensure consistency and adherence, and support efficiency, transparency, and procedural integrity. Within this evolving framework, arbitrators are entrusted with discretion to design and conduct proceedings in a manner responsive to the specific requirements of each dispute.

In practice, however:

- Arbitrators often rely on individual discretion and experience, leading to procedural divergence.
- There is no real-time, structured mechanism to assess whether procedural orders align with institutional rules and best practices.
- Parties lack visibility on whether procedural choices are cost-effective or institution-compliant.
- Institutions have limited data-driven insight into procedural adherence among arbitrators.

At present, no tool exists that assists arbitrators in designing arbitral procedures in accordance with the relevant institutional framework, while simultaneously considering the disputing parties’ convenience and cost-effectiveness.

In parallel, arbitral institutions do not presently have access to a structured tool through which they can review the procedural processes followed by arbitrators, and provide feedback or suggestions aimed at continuous improvement.

## Solution

**Procedo** is an AI-powered procedural intelligence tool designed to assist arbitrators, arbitral institutions, and disputing parties by:

- Providing non-binding procedural recommendations by reviewing procedural orders and case progress.
- Suggesting institution-compliant and cost-effective procedures.
- Generating a procedural compliance score benchmarked against institutional rules.
- Providing structured feedback to arbitrators.

The aim of this tool is to support informed procedural decision-making and self-review through structured, non-binding insights. It does **not** impose outcomes, enforce compliance, or function as an enforcement, supervisory, or disciplinary mechanism.

## Use Cases

### A. Procedural Guidance (Pre & During Arbitration)

- The arbitrator uploads procedural orders and case timelines / order sheets and selects the applicable institution’s rules.
- Procedo compares the proposed procedures with the institution’s rules, arbitration best practices, and soft law principles.
- The tool highlights areas where procedural choices are flexible and provides simple, non-binding suggestions aimed at improving efficiency.

### B. Procedural Review & Compliance Scoring (Post & During Arbitration)

- The institution or arbitrator uploads the complete procedural record and selects the applicable institution’s rules.
- Procedo maps the procedure followed against institutional rules and applicable guidelines.
- The tool outputs:
  - A **procedural compliance score**
  - Categorised feedback:
    - Fully compliant
    - Partially aligned
    - Deviations (with rationale)
  - Improvement suggestions for future cases

## Scope of AI Integration

1. **Document Intelligence**  
   NLP models analyse procedural orders, institutional rules, and related order sheets. The system extracts:
   - Procedural steps
   - Timelines
   - Mandatory vs discretionary rules
   - Relevant soft law aspects (predefined)

2. **Rule Mapping & Reasoning Engine**  
   The model maps procedural conduct against institutional rules and soft law principles, flagging:
   - Deviations
   - Gaps
   - Over-proceduralisation risks

3. **Recommendation Engine**  
   Uses historical arbitration patterns and cost-effectiveness heuristics to
